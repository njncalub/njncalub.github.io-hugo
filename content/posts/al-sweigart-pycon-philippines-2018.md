I remember reading [Al's book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) when I was just starting out. It's a beginner-friendly book and it helped me get a clearer understanding of what Python can do. Since then, I've been using it to get my younger cousins into programming.

Fast forward to 2018: I finally met him in person!
