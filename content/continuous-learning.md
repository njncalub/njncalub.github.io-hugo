## Why?

Software development is an endless pursuit of knowledge. There were many significant advancements in just the past decade and the tools and languages drastically change [every year](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f). The technologies you know today might already be obsolete tomorrow. How do you stay relevant in this age of fast-paced industry? The answer is **Continuous Learning**.

From [E-learning: Concepts, Trends, Applications](https://www.talentlms.com/elearning/continuous-learning):

> On a personal level, continuous learning is about the constant expansion of skills and skill-sets through learning and increasing knowledge. As life changes the need to adapt both professionally and personally is as real as the changes themselves.

> On a professional level, continuous learning is about further expanding our skill-set in response to a changing environment and new developments. This is very important because we are called to respond to changes daily; for example, the introduction of computers in the workplace created a need for people to train on computers to complete tasks more efficiently.

## What's this page about?

I added this online so that anyone can publicly view my progress. This is my way to pressure myself to continue learning and not slack off. [It might work for you, too](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-rule-of-commitment-2795890).
